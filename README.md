# gnome-shell-extension-mediaplayer

gnome-shell-extension-mediaplayer is a simple extension for controlling any MPRIS2 capable Mediaplayer.

This extension will monitor DBus to look for active players automatically (see "Compatible players" below for details). All active players are shown in the GNOME Shell volume menu by default.

## Screenshots

By default, media players show up in the volume menu:

But you can have the media players in a separate menu (see settings):

Notice the support of playlists in Banshee (MPRIS 2.1 player interface).
